# Training-Language-Model
Explanation of Key Steps

Data Preparation
Implemented a CustomTextDataset class to preprocess the text file and tokenize it using a pretrained tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2 tokenizer).
Ensured proper handling of the text for truncation, padding, and converting it into input tensors for the model.

Model Selection
Chose GPT-2, a transformer-based model, optimized for causal language modeling tasks where text is generated in an autoregressive manner.

Training Loop
Utilized the AdamW optimizer for parameter updates and employed a linear learning rate scheduler for smooth adjustment of learning rates.
Leveraged GPU acceleration for efficient training, with fallback support for CPU if GPU is unavailable.

Model Saving
Stored the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to enable reuse and deployment in downstream tasks.

Tools Used
PyTorch: Used for model training, gradient optimization, and loss computation.
Hugging Face Transformers: Provided the GPT-2 model and tokenizer for effortless integration.
Custom Dataset Loader: Designed for reading, cleaning, and tokenizing custom data effectively.

Challenges

Data Preparation:
Dealing with text encoding issues and ensuring the dataset was clean, with no unnecessary symbols or formatting errors.

Hardware Constraints:
Training large language models demands high compute resources like GPUs or TPUs, which may not always be accessible.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimizing parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and sequence length to achieve efficient and stableÂ training.
